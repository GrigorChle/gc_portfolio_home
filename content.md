Hi! \
My name is Grzegorz Chlechowicz,  but it's gonna be much simplier for both of us to call me Greg. \
On daily basis I work as Developer, mostly with AWS, Python and it's backend frameworks. \
After work I'm still trying to work on some personal projects which you can take a look or use by navigating here.

If you came here as recruiter I encoruge you to navigate to my Resume, which you can download.

Besides IT topic I spend my time on my yard doing some gardening and woodworking. I love feeling of satisfaction when my hard work pays off so I enjoy whenever I gather fruits or vegetables from my yard or when I build a new furniture.
